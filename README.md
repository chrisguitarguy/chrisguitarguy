I'm a platform engineer at [PMG](https://www.pmg.com/careers/) where I build the
tooling and applications that power our [Alli suite of marketing tools](https://alli.pmg.com)
behind the scenes.

I work primarily on AWS with some GCP thrown in here and there, all managed with
Terraform. I write code in JavaScript (frontend with React and Backend), Go,
PHP, and Python.
